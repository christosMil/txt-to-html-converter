# .txt to .html Converter
This project contains a bash file (*webCreator.sh*) that can convert a .txt file to .html file.
It's execution is simple, type in a terminal:
```
$./webCreator.sh {*folderDestination*} {*fileToBeConverted*}
```
If the script does not appear as *executable*, try granting ex. rights:
```
$chmod +x webCreator.sh 
```
The script was part of a larger one, that was developed for the needs of an Undergraduate Project
in *System Programming*. It was tested in Linux Ubuntu (16.04) and Linux Mint (17).
